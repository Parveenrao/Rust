/* Integer is a whole part (no decimal part) 

Rust use Singed and unsigned integer 

1 Signed Int ---> can be positive , negative and zero 

2 Unsigned Int ---> positive only 

* Default is i32 

*/


/*  usize and isize => 

They are pointer size integer 

* usized ----> unsized  pointer size integer 

* isized --->  isized pointer size integer 

  Why THey Exist 

  1 . Array indexing 
  2 . Slice lenght 
  3. Pointer Airthmetic

  All are represented using usize
